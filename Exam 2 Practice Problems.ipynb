    "You are rolling 2 dice and adding up the values. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Outcomes = \n",
    "2. If you roll these two dice an infinite number of times, what fraction of time would you roll a sum of 6? A sum of 9? A sum of 13?\n",
    "3. Are the events of rolling a sum of 3 and a sum of 9 disjoint? How about a sum of three and an odd? \n",
    "4. Find the probability of rolling a sum of 10 or an even number. \n",
    "5. Illustrate the probability distribution in a graph. \n",
    "6. Are the events of rolling a 9 and rolling a multiple of 3 independent? \n",

    "You are a teacher looking at test results. You find that 10% of students answered Question 10 right. Of the students that answered Question 10 right, 75% passed. Of the students that didnâ€™t answer the question right, 65% passed. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Illustrate the tree diagram for this problem.\n",
    "2. Find the marginal probability of answering Question 10 right. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "3. Find the conditional probability of passing the test given that you answer Question 10 right.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find the conditional probability of not passing the test given that you did not answer Question 10 right. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Find the joint probability of answering Question 10 right and not passing. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Find the joint probability of not answering Question 10 right and passing. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Find the conditional probability of answering Question 10 right given that you passed. \n",

    "Annie is conducting an experiment which examines the rate of premature babies born. The probability that a baby is born prematurely (born before 37 weeks gestation) is 7%. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If she sends out a survey randomly to 10 families, what is the probability that exactly 5 will come back indicating a premature birth?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If she sends out a survey randomly to 10 families, what is the probability that more than one will come back indicating a premature birth?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If she sends out a survey randomly to 10 families, what is the probability that fewer than 3 will come back indicating a premature birth?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Illustrate the probability distribution for this random variable. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Set 4: Normal Distribution + Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Samantha is conducting a survey of 300 college atheletes to estimate the average height of female basketball players. Assume height of female basketball players is a normally distributed random variable with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose the population mean is $\\mu=$ 72 inches(in) with a standard deviation of $\\sigma= $ 6 in. Find the probability of selecting a player under 60 in using the 65-95-99.7 rule. \n",
    "2. Suppose the population mean is $\\mu=$ 72 inches(in) with a standard deviation of $\\sigma= $ 6 in. Find the probability of selecting a player over 80 in. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Suppose the population mean is $\\mu=$ 72 inches(in) with a standard deviation of $\\sigma= $ 6 in. Find the probability of selecting a player  between 65 and 75 in tall. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Samantha's survey comes back and and she measures the point estimate for height to be 78.231. If the standard deviation of height is 6 in, what is the standard error for the point estimate?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Samantha's survey comes back and and she measures the point estimate for height to be 78.231. If the standard deviation of height is 6 in, create a 90% confidence interval for the population mean height. Can she reject the null hypothesis that the population mean is 72 in with 90% confidence?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Samantha's survey comes back and and she measures the point estimate for height to be 78.231. If the standard deviation of height is 6 in, create a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height. Can she reject the null hypothesis that the population mean is 72 in with 95% confidence?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Samantha's survey comes back and and she measures the point estimate for height to be 78.231. If the standard deviation of height is 6 in, create a 99% confidence interval for the population mean height. Can she reject the null hypothesis that the population mean is 72 in with 99% confidence?\n"
